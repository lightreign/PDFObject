Philip was working as an instructional designer and online course developer, and needed to embed a PDF into one of his courses. Having been a member of the SWFObject team, he was familiar with the complications of embedding media files into HTML documents.</p><p>In 2008, browsers generally didn&#39;t offer native support for media files (Flash, video, audio, PDFs). The few that did tended to use proprietary solutions. For PDFs, plugins like Adobe Reader and FoxIt bridged the gap, but as a web developer, you couldn&#39;t depend on the visitor having these plugins installed. This led to an era of JavaScript-based plugin detectors, enabling developers to present alternative content if the multimedia file wasn&#39;t supported. (The fallback content was usually a prompt to download a specific plugin.) PDFObject was created as a part of this trend; it enabled developers to verify PDF support before embedding the PDF.</p><p>The era&#39;s reliance on plugins ushered in the fight for web standards, spurring much debate around which media should be natively supported by browsers, and which HTML element(s) were best suited for embedding media files.</p><p>For Flash SWF files and PDFs, <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> was the most standards-compliant, and also natively supported fallback content. Thus, it was the element of choice for the SWF<strong>Object</strong> and PDF<strong>Object</strong> utilities. In both utilities, JavaScript would run a plugin detection routine, then handle any browser-specific gotchas, including switching to <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> for browsers that hiccuped when using <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>.</p><p>Over time, browser support for PDFs vastly improved (all major browsers now include native PDF rendering, no plugins required), ECMAScript/JavaScript evolved, and attitudes shifted.</p><p>In 2016, <a href="https://pipwerks.com/2016/04/21/pdfobject-2-0-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PDFObject was rewritten</a> to embrace a more modern approach, with a focus on pragmatism. <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> was eliminated, with <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> becoming the default. <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> was used in special circumstances.</p><p>Circa 2020, it became clear that <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> has become the most bulletproof method for embedding PDFs across all browsers. PDFObject 2.3 switched exclusively to <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> and no longer uses <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> in any scenarios.</p><p>As of 2024, PDFObject has been used millions of times across thousands of websites, averaging over 100,000 downloads a week on NPM.</p>',23),m=JSON.parse('{"title":"Why PDFObject?","description":"","frontmatter":{"outline":"deep"},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/why-pdfobject.md","filePath":"guide/why-pdfobject.md"}'),c={name:"guide/why-pdfobject.md"},g=Object.assign(c,{setup(h){const e=r.supportsPDFs;return(p,u)=>(i(),s("div",null,[d,n("p",null,"(In case you were wondering, this browser "+t(o(e)?"supports":"doesn't support")+" embedded PDFs.
